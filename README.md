# UniMelb-Essay-Template
A template for essays at the University of Melbourne (or any uni, with some editing). Includes a title page and the most useful packages.



So you're a Uni student wanting to write an essay with LaTeX? But you have no idea where to start? Here's a template complete with Title Page (set up as an undergrad essay cover, but everything can be modified obviously) and the most critical packages for essay writing.

This particular essay format will use the 2017  Semester 1 Essay Guide default formatting and citation recommendations for the School of History and Philosophy at The University of Melbourne. You should check the most current version before you try and hand this in, and probably check with your tutor that the page layout is okay.



If you're not using LaTeX, the attached pdf is probably a decent place to start. However, LaTeX is so pretty you should totally learn it.

Disclaimer: I'm not responsible for any loss of marks due to layout issues, or if you can't actually write an essay. If you can't be bothered to read the essay writing guide, that's your problem.
